# Facemoji

An experiment with the FaceDetector API. It puts emojis on your face!

To run it, you'll need:
 - Download [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html)
 - Enable `chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features`
 
Check out `src/app.js` to see how it works.
